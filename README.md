# ETEREA Super Aligner
A set of pie-menus and pop-overs that allows a very flexible access to a bunch of alignment tools.


# Usage:
1. Install Kit via Modo-Kit-Central.
2. Go to Menu System > Form Editor, open the “Forms” and search for “ETEREA Super Aligner” Form.
3. Right Mouse Button over it and choose “Assign to Key…”
4. Choose your shortcut. I have chosen ALT-< (it's a good option on a Spanish keyboard, not sure on an English one… anyway it's your election)
5. Now search for “ETEREA Straight Aligners” Form, very near.
6. Right Mouse Button over it and choose “Assign to Key…”
7. Choose your shortcut. I have chosen ALT-SHIFT-<
8. Close the Form Editor.
9. Enjoy.
